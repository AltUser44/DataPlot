The program outlines a Dash web application designed to visualize 2014 World GDP data through an interactive choropleth map and a bar chart. 
It details the process from importing necessary libraries, initializing the Dash app, loading the dataset, to creating and styling the visual components. 
Additionally, it includes a callback function that dynamically updates the bar chart based on user interactions with the map, 
enhancing the application's interactivity. This program serves as a guide for users and developers to understand how the application visualizes real-world data.
